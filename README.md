# Website Auditing Resources

The City of Sault Ste. Marie must regularly audit its websites
to ensure they are compatible with web standards and meet accessibility guidelines.

To assist with completing those audits, a checklist has be made to guide the audit process.
The checklist is available here for the benefit of others needing to complete website audits,
but also to allow collaboration when establishing the criteria for our audits.
